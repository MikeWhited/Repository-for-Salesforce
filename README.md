# Salesforce 
This will be a repository for all projects that I want documentation of so that it can be refrenced in building new things.

Some (but very few) of these will be atrifacts from Gabe or Old DISCO developers.

Many of these may be in other folders, but can be deleted out of other folders to keep lean. This will stay bulky and nothing will be deleted.
